        <p className="paragrahy">
          Building a design system from the ground up for every project is
          exhausting. Asiimov UI contains pre-built basic UI elements to help
          speed up your development.

          ðŸ“Œ Writing CSS for the same components isn't efficient.
        </h4>
        <p className="paragrahy">
          Your developer's time is precious. The time they could spend on
          writing functional code is taken up writing styles for components.
        </p>

        <h4 classname="subheading">
          ðŸ“Œ Asiimov UI isn't a framework-specific library.
        </h4>
        <p className="paragrahy">
          Asiimov UI provides a collection of professionally designed, every day
          UI components built on a framework-agnostic technology ie. it isn't
          dependent on any framework. Every component is written in vanilla CSS.
